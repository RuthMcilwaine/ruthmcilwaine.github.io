# My Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio site—built as a **single-page application (SPA)** for fast load times, reliability, and responsive design across devices. While it remains static to support deployment via GitHub Pages, the codebase has evolved to incorporate modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript practices. The design is minimalist, mobile-first, and emphasizes readability and visual clarity.

* Removed multi-page navigation, navbar, and hamburger menu for a cleaner, scroll-based SPA experience.
* Added **overlay containers** for text content to improve contrast against the background.
* Implemented responsive **project cards** linking to detailed project pages.
* Modernized folder and file structure for easier maintenance and scalability.
