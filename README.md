# My Portfolio

This repository contains my portfolio. Originally created as static web pages, the project is a work in progress. I want to modernize it to improve maintainability and responsiveness.

## Project Updates

In this update, I have modularized the HTML and CSS components to eliminate redundancy, making the site easier to maintain and update in the future. The portfolio is fully static, ensuring fast load times and reliability while still being responsive across different devices.

## Installation

To view the portfolio locally, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RuthMcilwaine/ruthmcilwaine.github.io.git
cd ruthmcilwaine.github.io
