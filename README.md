###My Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio, a fully static web app designed for fast load times, reliability, and responsiveness across different screen sizes. Originally built as a static web app, the project remains static while I continue to refine its design, maintainability, and structure.

###Live Web App

You can view the live version of my portfolio here:
[https://ruthmcilwaine.github.io](https://ruthmcilwaine.github.io)

The live version is updated regularly as I improve its design and functionality.

###Project Updates

    Modularized HTML and CSS components to reduce redundancy and improve maintainability.
    Improved responsiveness for better viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
    Reorganized the project structure to follow best practices, making future updates easier.
