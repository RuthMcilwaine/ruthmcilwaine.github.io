# My Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio site—built as a single-page experience for the homepage, About Me, Skills, Portfolio overview, and Contact sections, providing fast load times, reliability, and responsive design across devices. While it remains static to support deployment via GitHub Pages, the codebase uses modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript practices. The design is minimalist, mobile-first, and emphasizes readability and visual clarity. Individual portfolio projects open in separate pages for detailed views.
