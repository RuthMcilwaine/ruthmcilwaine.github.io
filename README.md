# My Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio siteâ€”built as a fully static web app for fast load times, reliability, and responsive design across devices. While it remains static to support deployment via GitHub Pages, the codebase has evolved to incorporate modern JavaScript practices and tooling. I continue to refine its design, structure, and maintainability to reflect my current front-end development skills.

## Live Web App

You can view the live version of my portfolio here:

The live version is updated regularly as I improve its design and functionality.

## Description

The purpose of my website is to showcase my work and my personal style at this point in my career to prospective clients or employers, both of which are my target audience.

Visitors can navigate my site and obtain the information they are seeking easily. The menu bar is clearly displayed on the screen, and I have included icons in the footer of the page which are links to my GitHub, CodePen, LinkedIn, and contact page. I used Font Awesome for all the icons. My logo also functions as a link to my homepage.

The client-side tech stack includes HTML, CSS, and Font Awesome, created with VSCode. I use GitHub to host my website.
