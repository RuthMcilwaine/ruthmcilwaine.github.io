**My Portfolio**

This repository contains my personal portfolio siteâ€”built as a fully static web app for fast load times, reliability, and responsive design across devices. While it remains static to support deployment via GitHub Pages, the codebase has evolved to incorporate modern JavaScript practices and tooling. I continue to refine its design, structure, and maintainability to reflect my current front-end development skills.

**Live Web App**

You can view the live version of my portfolio here:
[https://ruthmcilwaine.github.io](https://ruthmcilwaine.github.io)

The live version is updated regularly as I improve its design and functionality.

**Project Updates**

    Modularized HTML and CSS components to reduce redundancy and improve maintainability.
    Improved responsiveness for better viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
    Reorganized the project structure to follow best practices, making future updates easier.
