  <!-- Project Overview -->
  <section id="overview" class="section-overlay">
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p></p>
    <p>The Glen Eira McKinnon Bowls Club is a volunteer-run community sports club with a mostly retired membership. When I was engaged, their website was functional but fragile. Navigation was confusing, plugins were outdated, content was duplicated, and shared admin access created security risks</p>
    <p>The main goal was to simplify and modernise the site while keeping historical content intact and making it easy for both members and visitors to use. Rather than jumping straight into a visual redesign, I focused on safe, structured delivery — making the site clearer, easier to manage, and more sustainable for the long term.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Constraints -->
  <section id="constraints" class="section-overlay">
    <h2>Constraints</h2>
    <p></p>
    <p>The project faced several real-world constraints that shaped both the delivery framework and my approach:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The club is run by volunteers with varying availability, requiring consensus-based decisions.</li>
      <li>The membership is predominantly retired, which influenced accessibility and usability priorities.</li>
      <li>The site had a legacy WordPress structure with inconsistent page naming, outdated plugins, and shared credentials.</li>
      <li>No backups or staging environment.</li>
      <li>Live site actively used by members, requiring minimal disruption.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These factors required careful planning for every change, ensuring that technical decisions were safe and the committee remained confident in the process.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Role & Delivery -->
  <section id="role-delivery" class="section-overlay">
    <h2>My Role & Delivery</h2>
    <p></p>
    <p>I owned the project end-to-end, including:</p>
      <ul class="left">
        <li>discovery and benchmarking against local clubs</li>
        <li>risk assessment and sequencing of work</li>
        <li>delivery framework design (staging, backups, rollback)
        </li>
        <li>navigation and information architecture</li>
        <li>accessibility and SEO decisions</li>
        <li>stakeholder communication and approvals</li>
        <li>scope management across phases</li>
      </ul>
    <p>I made deliberate decisions on what not to change yet, balancing speed of delivery with committee comfort and technical safety.</p>
    <p>Delivery Framework Highlights:</p>
      <ul class="left">
        <li>Created full staging environment using WP Staging and a second purpose-specific staging site for theme and PHP upgrades</li>
        <li>Completed full cPanel backup including files, database, and email configuration</li>
        <li>Verified restore paths and rollback procedures</li>
        <li>Prioritised phased delivery to ensure clarity, reduce risk, and incorporate feedback iteratively</li>
      </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Key Decisions -->
  <section id="key-decisions" class="section-overlay">
    <h2>Key Decisions</h2>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1. Phased Delivery with Staging-Led Feedback</strong> 
        <p>Instead of a full redesign in a single release, I delivered the project in defined phases. This approach prevented overwhelming the committee and built confidence. Each phase focused on a specific area — navigation, homepage, content, or gallery — and required explicit sign-off before moving forward. The staging site acted as a shared review space, letting members explore changes at their own pace and provide asynchronous feedback. This approach minimized risk, maintained clarity, and allowed the project to progress steadily without surprises. Phasing was about protecting trust.</p></li>
        <p></p>
      <li><strong>2. Gallery Architecture & Content Governance</strong> 
        <p>A major challenge was how the club managed event photos: each event had its own page, resulting in a cluttered dashboard, inconsistent presentation, and slower site performance. I evaluated multiple solutions, including keeping pages, manual conversion to posts, and a post-based archive with categories. The final decision was to implement a **post-based, category-driven gallery system**. This allowed older events to be archived efficiently, reduced administrative effort for the committee, and enabled the homepage to automatically surface the latest posts. Committee approval was sought before expanding the system, ensuring everyone understood the long-term benefits.</p></li>
        <p></p>
      <li><strong>3. Staging + Backup Strategy Beyond Original Scope</strong> 
        <p>Upgrading PHP and core plugins carried a high risk of site breakage. To mitigate this, I created an isolated staging environment for testing, documented rollback procedures, and verified restore paths. This ensured platform stability, allowed high-risk updates to be applied safely, and kept the live site uninterrupted.</p></li>
        <p></p>
          <li><strong>4. Accessibility & SEO Enhancements</strong> 
            <p>Given the predominantly retired audience, I prioritised usability improvements. I refined menu visibility, added hover and underline states, simplified page structures, and ensured headings and labels were clear and descriptive. These enhancements improved navigation, accessibility, and information hierarchy, while also benefiting search engine visibility.</p></li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Outcome -->
  <section id="outcome" class="section-overlay">
    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p></p>
    <p>he phased, risk-aware approach delivered measurable results and strengthened long-term sustainability. Navigation was simplified and more accessible, platform health was stabilised, and technical debt was reduced. The committee could explore the staging site at their own pace and provide feedback without pressure. Importantly, there were no live-site disruptions, and the process established a low-risk workflow for future updates. This structured delivery demonstrates thoughtful planning, stakeholder management, and sound technical judgment</p>
    <p>Key highlights:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Navigation simplified and optimized for committee and visitor use</li>
      <li>Platform health stabilised, reducing future maintenance overhead</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- What’s Next -->
  <section id="next" class="section-overlay">
    <h2>What’s Next</h2>
    <p></p>
    <p>Phase 3 will focus on finalising and transitioning the site with minimal disruption. Key next steps include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Replacing and optimising all images across the site</li>
      <li>Refining page content and layout for clarity and usability</li>
      <li>Completing gallery migration, ensuring all posts are properly archived and categorized</li>
      <li>Continuing iterative improvements based on committee feedback</li>
      <li>Maintaining a low-maintenance, scalable framework for long-term management</li>
    </ul>
